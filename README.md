# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling method.

The original paper, that introduced this method is described in:

   1. Simon Duane, Anthony D. Kennedy, Brian J. Pendleton and Duncan Roweth (1987).
   "Hybrid Monte Carlo". Physics Letters B. 195 (2): 216–222.

Several implementation details are given in:

   2. Radford M. Neal (1996). "Monte Carlo Implementation".
   Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks. Springer. pp. 55–98.

The generalized sampling approach is described in:
